Subject: Issue with Recent Order #12345

Dear Customer Service,

I received my order yesterday, but the product arrived damaged. The box was crushed and the item inside is not functioning properly. I would like a replacement or refund.

This is very disappointing as I needed this for an important project that starts next week. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years and expected better quality control.

I've attached photos of the damage. Please respond urgently.

Regards,
Michael Chen
